# Plateautem

A Valheim mod that adds a totem for terrain flattening. 

## Instructions
WIP

The totem needs to supplied with fuel, stone and tools depending on what you want it to do.
- All operations require fuel.
- Lowering terrain requires a pickaxe and will generate stone.
- Raising terrain requires a hoe and will consume stone.
- Higher tier pickaxes will be slowed down less by the digging operation.

Most features can be modified in the config file in your Valheim install folder at `Valheim/BepInEx/config/com.erkle64.Plateautem.cfg`
